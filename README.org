* Modern-theme
Theme based on ~spacemacs-theme~, ~tomorrow~ and ~doom-one-light~

Three variants available for now:
- ~modern-light~
- ~modern-dark~
- ~modern-dawn~

** Install
   On spacemacs ~develop~ branch:
   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
   dotspacemacs-themes '(
                         (modern-dawn :location (recipe :fetcher github :repo "fuxialexander/modern-light-theme"))
                         (modern-dark :location (recipe :fetcher github :repo "fuxialexander/modern-light-theme"))
                         (modern-light :location (recipe :fetcher github :repo "fuxialexander/modern-light-theme"))
                         )
   #+END_SRC

** Known issue
   Only works for GUI emacs, in terminal it fallbacks to ~spacemacs-dark~ or ~spacemacs-light~.
